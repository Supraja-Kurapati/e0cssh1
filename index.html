        <li>Css stands for Cascading style sheets.</li>

          Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,Paper,or
          in other media.

          It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

      </ol>
      <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 Ways:</h2>
      <div class="new"><ul><li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li><li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li><li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file</li><li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="bg"><b> in This
tutorial we will use Inline and internal styles,</b></span> because this is easier to demostrate and easier
for you to try it yourself. </li></ul></div>
      <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference in that CSS class applies
        a style to multiple elements,ID,on the othet hand, applies a style to
        one unique element. ID is also<br />
        special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element
        and its used by Java Script.
        <br /><br />
        In CSS, Selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
        elements on a webpage.Once element has been targeted,a style or set of
        styles can be applied to the <br />
        element.<br /><br />
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
        used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style
        should be applied.
